# LinearRegressionProject
 Project for Applied Statistics course using linear regression.
 Part 1 performs stepwise regression ona data set with 4 predictors to determine the final model.
 Part 1 also performs a best subset regression to determine the final model. 
 Residual analysis is used to check the final models found using the above methods. 
 
 Part 2 perfoms an analysis of the CDI dataset in the text Applied Linear Statistical Models (Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, Li). 
 Variance inflation factors are obtained.
 Studentized deleted residuals are obtained, a dot plot is examined for outliers. 
 The diagonal elements of the hat matrix are found and are used to identify extreme elements. 
 DFFITS, DFBETAS, and Cook's distance are calculated to asses influnce of possible outliers.
